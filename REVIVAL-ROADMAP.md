### Remaining:
- Build Qt GUI wallet for user-friendly interface
- Create video/screenshots of mining in action

**Timeline:** Complete this weekend (Oct 26-27)

---

## Phase 2: Multi-Node Network (Next Priority)

**Goal:** Prove P2P networking works - demonstrate it's a real network, not just solo mining

### Tasks:

#### 2.1: Local Multi-Node Test via Tailscale
- Install/configure Tailscale on Mac
- Set up Node 2 in separate directory
- Connect Node 2 to Node 1 via Tailscale IP
- Verify blockchain sync between nodes
- Test block propagation (mine on one, verify other receives it)
- Document P2P connectivity

**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Cost:** $0
**Deliverable:** Video showing 2 nodes syncing blocks

#### 2.2: Cross-Platform Validation (Optional)
- Set up Raspberry Pi as third node
- Prove ARM compatibility
- Test 24/7 seed node concept

**Time estimate:** 4-6 hours
**Cost:** $0 (if Pi already owned)

---

## Phase 3: Visual Proof - Block Explorer

**Goal:** Public website anyone can visit to SEE Badcoin is alive

### Infrastructure Setup:

#### 3.1: VPS Provisioning
- Rent VPS (DigitalOcean/Vultr/Linode)

## Phase 4: Easy Onboarding - DNS Seeds Update

**Goal:** Make joining the network dead simple

### Tasks:

#### 4.1: Update Hardcoded Seed Nodes
**File:** `src/chainparams.cpp`

**Changes:**
```cpp
// Replace dead seeds:
vSeeds.push_back("165.227.13.253:9012");  // DEAD
vSeeds.push_back("157.230.56.219");       // DEAD

// With your nodes:
vSeeds.push_back("YOUR_VPS_IP:9012");     // Your public VPS
vSeeds.push_back("YOUR_TAILSCALE_IP:9012"); // Tailscale network
```

**Time:** 15 minutes
**Cost:** $0

#### 4.2: Rebuild and Test
- Rebuild badcoind with new seeds
- Test fresh node auto-connects
- Create binary releases for Mac/Linux

**Time:** 1-2 hours

#### 4.3: Distribution

## Questions Before We Proceed:

1. **How many blocks do you want to mine before announcing?** (100, 500, 1000?)

2. **Do you want to invest in VPS now** ($20/month) **or start with Tailscale** (free)?

3. **Priority: GUI first or Explorer first?**
   - GUI = Better demo of completeness
   - Explorer = Public proof anyone can verify

4. **Timeline pressure?** Need this done by specific date?

**Let me know your preferences and I'll create detailed step-by-step guides for each phase!**
